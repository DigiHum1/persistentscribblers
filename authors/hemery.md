# Francis Hobart Hemery 

Francis Hobart Hemery was born at sea on the 22nd March 1847, the son of John and Anna Hemery (nee Beatty). He was baptised in Jersey on the 12 May. 
He joined the navy in [   ] was appointed sub lieutenant on 11 September 1860. (NA - ADM 196/17/58) and in the 1861 census he is a naval cadet. He was assigned to H.M.S _Achilles_, a broadside ironclad frigate which defended the waters of the English Channel as part of the Channel Fleet, as a sub-lieutenant on the 5 June 1867.  The Captain was E.W. Vansittart.
Francis was invalided two years later on the 30th April 1869.  He was reported fit for duty three months later on the 2nd August and joined the crew of H.M.S Inconstant on the 12th of that month, once again as part of the Channel Fleet. Two months later on the 14th October, he was sent to Haslar Hospital per H.M.S. Helicon for “general mania”. He was discharged from the hospital on the 7th May 1870, after a six and a half months stay. General mania was defined by William Augustus Guy in his Principles of Forensic Medicine in 1845 as “a form of mania which affects both the intellect and the passions, and throws the whole mind into a state of mingled excitement and confusion.” It was characterised by Pinel as a “rapid succession of uninterrupted alternation of insulated ideas, and evanescent and unconnected emotions” as well as by an “abolition of the faculty of judgement.” It was clear that Francis was unfit for the responsibilities placed upon him.

On release from hospital, Francis was assigned to H.M.S _Duke of Wellington_, the flagship of the Port Admiral at Portsmouth, four days later on the 11th. The flagship fired salutes to passing dignitaries such as Queen Victoria on her way to Osborne House. It was clearly a softer option for a man who was seen as lacking judgement.  Three months later on the 10th August, he was sent to H.M.S. _Repulse_, a guardship at Queensferry, for temporary service, returning to the Duke of Wellington on the 21st October. On the 15th March in the following year, he was assigned to H.M.S _Danae_, when recommissioned, taking a passage out to North America in H.M.S _Himalaya_. He is recorded in the census in Devonshire. 
His time on the Danae was to be short and after thirteen days he was sent home unfit. On the 17 November 1871 he was deemed to be unfit and ten days later was granted 2/6 (home pay?) . He was retired from the navy on the 20 February 1872.
